<p align="center"> In all honesty, for the whole school year, I could say that ICT 9's 4TH quarter would be my prime. It was the quarter where I nailed every single test and hands-on or activities Miss Uminga gave us. It means that my study habits are improving!! It made me realize though, that the school year was ending. So far, Grade 9 Fidelity would be the section I would dearly miss. From the goofy memories of my class, to the most considering and kind teachers. I would really miss them and long for them. This would probably be my last entry in my E-Portfolio!! Though I had a hard time catching up on the deadlines, it was really fun making this, I explored codes, and I get to design my personal website. Mamimiss ko kayo, Fidel, and the teachers. Especially you po, Miss U!! Thank you for the never ending patience and guidance you gave us throughout the school year! Love you so much Miss !!  </p>
