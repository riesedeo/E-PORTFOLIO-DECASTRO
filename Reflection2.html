<p align="center"> During my second quarter in ICT 9, I encountered and overcame many challenges, including complex lessons, difficult hands-on tasks, and tight deadlines for projects, notes, and assignments. Despite the difficulties, I was able to tackle each one by coming up with the best possible solutions. However, I couldn’t have achieved these without the support of my classmates, friends, and, most importantly, my ICT teacher, Ms. Uminga. Their guidance and encouragement played a significant role in helping me reach my goals this quarter. This quarter was definetely harder than the last one, and surely the next few quarters will also be difficult but I know I will be able to conquer it all. Looking ahead, there are areas I want to improve on for the next quarter: avoiding procrastination, enhancing critical thinking, sharpening my focus, and developing proper study habits. By working on these, I believe I can achieve better grades than before. Ultimately, my goal is to consistently improve my performance each quarter.  </p>
